I received my PhD degree in Control Science and Engineering from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn/), Wuhan, China, in March 2024 (2020.09~2024.03). Before that, I received my M.S. degree in Circuits and Systems from [Hubei University](https://www.hubu.edu.cn/), Wuhan, China, in June 2019 (2016.09~2019.06). My research interests involve renormalization and robustness of complex networks, social networks, information science, and graph neural networks.
